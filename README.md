Present functionality limited to list and install

**Operating Systems**

Python 3.6 - Linux/OSX

**Setup**

Create a temporary alias in a terminal by running:

**$** `alias slack="python3 path/to/microslack/core.py"`

You will likely wish to make this permanent (add to .bashrc, or wherever you store your aliases).


Setup is as easy as running:

`slack setup install`

You will need to [generate your user token](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens) for the workspace you wish to use with microslack.
