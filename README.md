**Setup**

Get started by creating a temporary alias in a terminal by running:

`alias slack="python3 path/to/microslack/core.py"`

Then, to install dependencies (pip modules: argparse, slackclient) run:

`slack install new`

[Generate your user token](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens) for the workspace you wish to use with microslack.

`slack install token`

If microslack isn't working (error or otherwise), you may need to regenerate your token and run `slack install token` again.
